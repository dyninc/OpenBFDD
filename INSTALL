+ Basic Installation From Distribution Package
=====================
                                     
See the "Build and Install" wiki page at 
https://github.com/dyninc/OpenBFDD/wiki/Building-the-OpenBFDD-Project for 
more detailed build instructions.

If you are building OpenBFDD from a distribution package, the following 
should build and install the package if run from the directory containing 
the package source code:

   ./configure ; make ; make install

This will builds and install bfdd-beacon, bfdd-control and the manpages 
for both of these.
