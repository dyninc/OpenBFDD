================
+ Intro
================

OpenBFDD is an open source package that provides a software based 
implantation of the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol. It 
is designed to run on a server. Its primary purpose is to allow the 
administrator to quickly take the server off-line when the core service, 
such as a bind or unbound server, goes down. This is done by providing a 
BFD "beacon", bfdd-beacon, that can communicate with a properly 
configured, BFD enabled, router. A control utility, bfdd-control, can be 
used to configure the running bfdd-beacon daemon, and to change the state 
of its BFD sessions. 

================
+ Building and Installing
================

See the included INSTALL document for instructions on building and 
installing the OpenBFDD tools and documentation.


================
+ License
================

See the included COPYING file for licensing information.


================
+ Platforms
================

The software was originally developed on FreeBSD 7.1. It has been built, 
and tested on the following platforms:
   
   * FreeBSD 7.1 amd64
   * FreeBSD 8.1 amd64
   * Debian 2.6.26-2-amd64
   * Debian 2.6.26-2-686 (i386)

It may, or may not, be possible to build and run it on other BSD and Linux 
platforms without modification. If your system is not included, then we  
encourage you o make the modifications necessary and submit them to 
http://github.com/dyninc/OpenBFDD/ for inclusion in future releases.


================
+ About bfdd-beacon
================

The bfdd-beacon is a daemon that implements a simple, configurable, 
Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) client. When running the 
bfdd-control utility can be used to control and communicate with the 
bfdd-beacon. 

Once the project is installed, you can obtain more information using `man 
bfdd-beacon' 

== Communication ==

Currently the bfdd-beacon opens two ports 957 and 958 on 127.0.0.1 to 
allow for socket communication with the bfdd-control utility. The first 
port is "primary" and is used by default. This will probably be made 
configurable in the future.

== Timing ==

BFD requires that packets be sent with fairly precise timing. Since 
bfdd-beacon is implemented in software and is running on the same platform
s other services, it is possible for the link to go "down" under system 
stress conditions. Further testing will be needed to determine if this is 
an actual issue. 

== Notes ==

While the bfdd-beacon does (as of v 0.2.0) support setting "Required 
Minimum Receive Interval" to 0, not all remote platforms support it. See 
the "Notes on Remote BFD Platforms" section in this document for more 
details Therefore it is advisable not to set "Required Minimum Receive 
Interval" to 0 without first testing the feature, and confirming that the 
remote system supports this.

================
+ About bfdd-control
================

The bfdd-control is a utility that communicates with the bfdd-beacon 
daemon when it is running. Once the project is installed, you can obtain 
more information, including a complete list of  command that can be sent 
to the bfdd-beacon using `man bfdd-control'

== Communication ==

See also the Communication section of the `About bfdd-beacon' entry in 
this document as well. Communication normally happens through a single 
(primary) port. It is unlikely, put possible, for connection to fail if 
multiple simultaneous instances of bfdd-control are being run. For that 
reason a second, alternate, port is provided as a backup, or when making 
repeated bfdd-control calls, such as a "monitoring" script. Use the 
`--altport' parameter as described in the bfdd-control manpage.

================
+ Limitations and Bugs
================

   * BFD Demand Mode ( http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5880#section-6.6 ) is
   not implemented in the current version.

   * BFD Echo Mode ( http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5880#section-6.4 ) is 
   not implemented in the current version.

   * BFD Authentication ( http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5880#section-6.7 )
   s not implemented in the current version.  

   * Although it attempts to follow the protocol specification, it was 
   designed and tested to work with the Juniper line of routers. It has 
   currently been tested with JUNOS 8.5.


================
+ Notes on Remote BFD Platforms
================

bfdd-beacon communicates with a "remote" system. Since the BFD 
specification was, until recently, in the draft stage, and many 
implementations may have not been fully exercised, this page provides a 
location for notes about various BFD implementations.

== JUNOS 8.5S4 ==

   * This platform does not handle a remote "Required Minimum Receive 
   Interval" of 0. It treats it as an actual 0 value and proceeds to spew 
   control packets at the fastest possible rate. This is contrary to the 
   bfd.RequiredMinRxInterval clause in Section 6.8.1 of RFC 5880 ( 
   http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5880#section-6.8.1 ). Therefore it is 
   advisable not to set "Required Minimum Receive Interval" to 0 with this
   ystem.

   * This platform does not set bfd.RemoteDiscr to 0 after a Detection 
   time has elapsed, as mandated by the bfd.RemoteDiscr clause in Section
   .8.1 of RFC 5880  ( http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5880#section-6.8.1 
   ). It maintains bfd.RemoteDiscr for 2 detection times. Without the 
   "workaround" the result is that is a session is removed, either 
   intentionally, or from a timeout on our end, the remote system will 
   continue to send packets with a non-zero "Your Discriminator", 
   preventing us from starting a new session. A "workaround" for this has
   been added. Passive sessions are now not deleted (and so the 
   discriminator is maintained) for at least 3 times the remote detection
   time. 
 

   * This platform, in some cases, delays sending a packet when its state 
   changes from Down to Init. This is contrary to Section 6.8.7 paragraph 
   10 of RFC 5880  ( http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5880#section-6.8.7 ). 
   This section does refer to "SHOULD", not "MUST", so this is not 
   technically a bug. It can be seen when the local system goes from 
   Up->AdminDown->Up. If the period spent in AdminDown is relatively short
   ompared with the "Local Desired Min Rx Interval", then the Local state 
   will transition from AdminDown->Down and the Remote system will 
   immediately transition to the Init state, but it will delay sending a 
   packet, despite the state change, until the next scheduled transmit. 
   This can delay the Local systems transition to the Up state. A 
   workaround has been added, and is enabled by default. This consists of 
   setting the Poll bit on the packet for the transition from 
   AdminDown->Down. This will force the remote system to respond 
   immediately. See `session set admin_up_poll' in the bfdd-control manpage.
