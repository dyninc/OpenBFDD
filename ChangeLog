2010-10-18  Jake Montgomery  Update Version to 0.3.0

   * Now builds and runs on Linux (Debian).

   * Systems that do not have ::kevent() will use a ::select() based  
     scheduler.

   * No longer uses signals (SIGUSR1) for self notification, since this 
     was problematic when porting from kevent to select. 

   * Formatting and other small changes and improvements.

   * Fixed accept bug that only manifested in 32 bit systems. 

2010-10-07  Jake Montgomery Update Version to 0.2.1
   
   * Improved low memory handling. There is now, at least, a good chance  
     that existing sessions will continue to stay up in low memory 
     situations. Memory failures during setup of bfdd-beacon will still 
     crash, since there is no real damage that can be done at that point.

   * Fixed small bug where a "select" error due to interrupt could 
     permanently disable a bfdd-command communications port in 
     bfdd-beacon.

    * Initial OpenBFDD code and build.
